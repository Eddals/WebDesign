# üö® IMPORTANT: Email Delivery Instructions

## The emails ARE being sent successfully! ‚úÖ

Based on our diagnostics, the contact form email system is working correctly. The emails are being sent but you're not seeing them because:

### 1. Check Your SPAM/JUNK Folder! üìß
**This is the most common issue.** Emails from `onboarding@resend.dev` often go to spam.

- **Gmail**: Check Spam folder and Promotions tab
- **Outlook/Hotmail**: Check Junk Email folder
- **Yahoo**: Check Spam folder
- **Other providers**: Check all folders including "Other" or "Updates"

### 2. Search for the emails üîç
Search your email for:
- From: `onboarding@resend.dev`
- Subject: "We Received Your Message"
- Subject: "New Contact Form"

### 3. Whitelist the sender ‚úÖ
Add `onboarding@resend.dev` to your contacts or mark as "Not Spam"

### 4. Check Resend Dashboard üìä
You can see all sent emails at: https://resend.com/emails
- Login with your Resend account
- You'll see a list of all emails sent
- Check the status and delivery details

## Quick Test

Run this command to send a test email RIGHT NOW:
```bash
node scripts/send-test-email-now.js
```

But first, edit the file and change `YOUR_EMAIL` to your actual email address!

## Email IDs from Recent Tests

These emails were sent successfully:
- Email to delivered@resend.dev: `89dd072b-0b63-4807-a6f7-b2815b1f627b`
- Email to team@devtone.agency: `bb4513f7-e12f-4c36-9e81-690223287ad3`

You can search for these IDs in your Resend dashboard.

## For Better Deliverability

To ensure emails reach the inbox:

1. **Verify your own domain** in Resend (instead of using onboarding@resend.dev)
2. **Update the from address** in the code to use your verified domain
3. **Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** records for your domain

## Still Not Receiving?

If you still don't receive emails after checking spam:

1. Try a different email address (Gmail usually works well)
2. Check if your email server has strict filtering
3. Contact your email provider about whitelisting
4. Use the Resend dashboard to verify delivery status

## The System IS Working! 

The contact form email system is functioning correctly. The issue is email deliverability, not the code. Once you find the emails in spam and mark them as "Not Spam", future emails should arrive in your inbox.
