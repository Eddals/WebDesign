# 🔧 Webhook Configuration for Resend

## ✅ Email Sending is Working!

Your domain `devtone.agency` is verified and emails are sending successfully. The UUID error is related to the webhook configuration.

## 🎯 Fix the Webhook Issue

### Option 1: Use the Simple Webhook (Recommended)

1. Go to [Resend Webhooks](https://app.resend.com/webhooks)
2. Edit your webhook
3. Change the endpoint URL to:
   ```
   https://devtone.agency/api/webhooks/resend-simple
   ```
4. Save changes

### Option 2: Remove Webhook Temporarily

1. Go to [Resend Webhooks](https://app.resend.com/webhooks)
2. Delete the webhook
3. Emails will still send, you just won't get event notifications

### Option 3: Create a New Webhook

1. Delete the existing webhook
2. Create a new one with:
   - **Endpoint URL**: `https://devtone.agency/api/webhooks/resend-simple`
   - **Events**: Select the events you want to track
   - **Signing Secret**: Will be generated automatically

## 📊 What's Working Now

- ✅ Domain verified (`devtone.agency`)
- ✅ Emails sending successfully
- ✅ Both admin and client emails work
- ❌ Webhook events (UUID error)

## 🧪 Test Your Form

Since emails are working, test your form:

1. **Local Test**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   node test-form-submission.js
   ```

2. **Live Test**:
   - Go to https://devtone.agency/estimate
   - Fill out the form
   - Submit
   - Check emails at sweepeasellc@gmail.com

## 📝 The UUID Error Explained

The error `"The id must be a valid UUID"` suggests:
- The webhook endpoint might be expecting a different format
- There could be a mismatch between what Resend sends and what the endpoint expects
- Using the simpler webhook endpoint should fix this

## 🚀 Bottom Line

**Your email system is working!** The webhook is optional - it's just for tracking email events (opened, clicked, etc.). You can:
1. Fix it by using the simple webhook
2. Remove it and add it back later
3. Leave it as is - emails still work fine

The important part (sending emails) is working perfectly! 🎉
