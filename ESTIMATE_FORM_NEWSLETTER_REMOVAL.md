# Estimate Form Newsletter Removal

## Overview
Removed the newsletter signup section that appeared after completing the estimate form to streamline the user experience and reduce unnecessary interruptions.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Removed Newsletter Section**
**File**: `src/pages/Estimate.tsx`

#### Removed Components:
- **EmailForm component**: Newsletter signup form
- **Newsletter section**: Entire motion.div containing the newsletter signup
- **Import statement**: EmailForm import

#### Code Removed:
```tsx
{/* Newsletter Signup */}
<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 20 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ delay: 0.4 }}
  className="max-w-2xl mx-auto"
>
  <EmailForm
    title="Stay Updated on Your Project"
    subtitle="Get development tips, industry insights, and exclusive updates while we work on your proposal"
    placeholder="Already have your email? Get our newsletter!"
    buttonText="Subscribe to Updates"
    successMessage="Great! You'll receive valuable insights while we prepare your proposal."
  />
</motion.div>
```

### 2. **Updated Animation Delays**
- **Before**: Important Notes section had `delay: 0.6`
- **After**: Important Notes section now has `delay: 0.4`
- **Reason**: Compensate for removed newsletter section timing

### 3. **Removed Import**
```tsx
// Removed this import
import EmailForm from '@/components/EmailForm';
```
