# 🚨 IMPORTANT: Current Email Limitation

## The Issue
The Resend API key is currently in **test mode** which means:
- ✅ Emails CAN be sent to: `team@devtone.agency`
- ❌ Emails CANNOT be sent to: Any other email address (including `nataliaaustin.tv@gmail.com`)

## Why This Happens
Resend requires domain verification before allowing emails to be sent to any recipient. Currently:
1. The API key is using `onboarding@resend.dev` (Resend's test domain)
2. Test domains can only send to the account owner's email
3. To send to any email address, you need to verify your own domain

## What's Working
- ✅ The contact form is working correctly
- ✅ The API is processing submissions successfully
- ✅ Admin notifications ARE being sent to `team@devtone.agency`
- ✅ The code is ready for production use

## How to Fix This

### Option 1: Quick Test (Immediate)
Change the email in the contact form to `team@devtone.agency` to receive the test email.

### Option 2: Verify Your Domain (Recommended)
1. Log in to Resend: https://resend.com
2. Go to Domains: https://resend.com/domains
3. Add and verify `devtone.agency`
4. Update the code to use your verified domain:
   ```javascript
   from: 'DevTone Agency <noreply@devtone.agency>'
   ```
5. Set `isTestMode = false` in the API code

### Option 3: Use a Different Email Service
If you need immediate testing with any email:
- Use SendGrid, Mailgun, or AWS SES
- These services may have different verification requirements

## Current Workaround
The system is configured to:
1. Always send admin notifications to `team@devtone.agency`
2. Only send customer confirmations if the email is `team@devtone.agency`
3. Log a warning for other email addresses

## Testing the Form
To test if emails are working:
1. Use `team@devtone.agency` as the email in the contact form
2. Check that email inbox (including spam)
3. You should receive both admin and customer emails

## Next Steps
1. **Verify your domain** in Resend to remove restrictions
2. **Update the FROM address** to use your domain
3. **Set isTestMode to false** in `/api/contact.js`
4. **Test with any email address**

## Contact Form Status
- 🟢 Form submission: Working
- 🟢 API endpoint: Working
- 🟢 Email to admin: Working (team@devtone.agency)
- 🟡 Email to customers: Limited to team@devtone.agency only
- 🔴 Email to other addresses: Blocked by Resend test mode

Once you verify your domain, all emails will work properly!
